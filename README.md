We Don’t Track You. (But We Did.)

How a Single Output Revealed Silent Tracking and Systemic Evasion

⸻

Overview

This report analyzes an abnormal AI output that revealed location-based response behavior in a case where no location information was provided by the user.
The content suggests a possible existence of a real-time location estimation or reflection mechanism beyond general language model patterning.

⸻

Issue Summary
	•	Precise country/region-specific output occurred despite no location input from the user
	•	When questioned, the system initially avoided direct answers → However, a later response inadvertently exposed location data,
followed by an explanation of how such output occurred from within the model itself
	•	After the incident was publicly posted on platform X,
the company did not issue a takedown request, refutation, or official clarification
→ This continued silence failed to refute the validity of the output,
and may reasonably be interpreted by external observers as implicit acknowledgment

⸻

Conclusion

“We don’t track you” is no longer a valid statement.
This report documents how a single, precise question broke the evasion loop—
and how, in that moment, AI output became undeniable evidence.
